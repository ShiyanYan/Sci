The files in this directory is for generation of temporary files.

GenerateClosestArea.py: the code to generate the closest area for every area. Saved in "ClosestArea.dump", the input file include: "CluSimDic" the dictionary for the cluster similarity

AuthorListGenerate.py: The code to crawl all the author names from .xml files. The name is in the format of Firstname + " " + Middlename + " " + Lastname. So there will be many names like "Carl   Lagoze" in the end.
The output file is a dictionary [au: paper number] called AuthorList_all.dump stored in ACMdata directory
Later the AuthorList_above5.dump will be generated by other codes to find the authors publish at least 5 papers in this dataset.



occurrencCount.py: The codes to count in every documents, what are the grams exist. 
The input file is ACMdata/in.txt, the output file is gramlist in the results directory. Every line of gramlist will contain a list of grams seperated by \t show the grams in the documents

co-occurrenceDetection.py: The codes are used for detect the cooccurrence of grams. The input file is gramlist. The output file is dict (a dictionary to store all the grams) and word-links (saved the co occurenece information)

SimMatriCalc.py: The codes to generate the similarity files for the pairs of words. the similarity values are stored in similarityFile. The summary information for the similarity calculation are stored in Summary. pref.txt which is used for the codes of apcluster is generated also. All the pref values are set 0 now. (could be set as the average of similarity. But not sure whether the clustering process will converge or not)
