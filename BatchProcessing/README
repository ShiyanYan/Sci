The shell scripts in this directory are the batch processing codes.

apcluster-preporocess.sh: The scripts make use of three scripts from /LangProc. The process is mainly about get the occurence similarity between grams in th dict. The similarityFile store the similarity information that are useful for apcluster

apcluster.sh: The script to run the apcluster codes. input files contain: similarityFile and pref.txt. The clustering results will be processed by TopicsShow.py in /TopicExtract 

paperAssign.sh: The script used to assign the papers according to the results of previous clustering, "IdMatchTopics" will be the most important result file used by other scripts later

showAuthorAssign.sh: The script used to show some the topic assignment results for specific authors.

MetricsCalc.sh: The script will use many codes that calculate scores for some metrics

CoheCalc.sh: The script will calculate the coherence of every cluster according to the Average Distance, Coauthor Porportion and Citation information. And the similarity between clusters (average gram similarity)
