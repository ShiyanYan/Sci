The codes in this directory is used for generation the metrics time series of each users or average users. 
For each user, the code (time-variation-single.py)(not updated now) can generate a .csv file for R to draw the graph
For average users, the codes (time-variation-average-N1/N2.py  with different normalization) can generate the .csv file for R to draw the graph also.

The file metricesCal.py is very important. It provde the function to calculate all the values of metrics. It will be imported by many other codes in this project.
